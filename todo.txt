In order for the function to work properly it must:

	1. convert the input image to gray scale - remove all color information, leaving only shades ranging from gray to white
	2. split the image into M x N tiles - need to create a matrix/grid to be able to process individual pieces of the image
	3. correct M (number of rows) to match the image and font aspect ratio - want to ensure text fits propirtionally with the image
	4. compute the average brightness for each image tile and then look up a suitable ASCII character for each - match each tile with an ASCII character depending on level 
	of brightness, will allow us to generate different characters from the originally different colors
	5. assemble rows of ASCII character strings and print them to a file to form the final image - once we have the tiles mapped to a character we must assemble the art! then output it to
	file that will be able to show the full display
